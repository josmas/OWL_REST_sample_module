Tasks
-----
X Create new cell from the cell tutorial with a listener for mouse.
Create a content menu to register instead of the mouse click.
X Add REST calls (old code with GET and POST).
Connect the click with a POST Action
Refactor REST calls and try to separate them (a component?).
Add UPDATE and DELETE support.

Tests
-----
Mock the connection to the web server and skip integration tests.


//Design: Group all the REST specific code in a separate class so that it can
be testable out of the world.

//Idea for the component: In the properties panel we can attach the strings to
send or return, depending on the operation (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE).
